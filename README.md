## About Indie Businesses

An indie business (short for "independent") is a business typically owned and operated by individuals or small groups of people who wish to maintain a high degree of control over their businesses and production.

Indie businesses are often characterized by their focus on creativity and innovation, and they can be found in a wide range of industries, including music, film, art, fashion, and technology.

Indie businesses are often smaller and more niche-oriented than large companies, and they typically place great emphasis on having a unique brand and a strong presence on social media and other online platforms.

Overall, indie businesses are characterized by their independence and their desire to take responsibility for their own creative and business decisions.
