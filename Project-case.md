## 6 Tips to Create Your Life Coach Website

Here’s how to implement these ideas and create a website that you’re really proud of.

1. Get Some Engaging and Professional Images of Yourself
   - Think about it: The first thing you saw when exploring the websites above was professional and captivating photographs of coaches. Your website visitors need to put a face to who they will be working with. Professional photographs will give you credibility and make an impactful first impression.
   - This is not about your looks or how fancy your set design is. It’s about showing an image of yourself that conveys your core values as a coach.
   - For some, it might be joy, while other coaches might want to create a sense of warmth and compassion. Think about how you can visualize your brand identity in a picture and hire a professional photographer who understands great lighting.
2. Create a Brand Statement or Tagline
   - Once your images are sorted, you need to think of a catchy tagline. This statement should clearly reveal your specialty and what results your clients will get if they work with you.
   - It’s the second thing visitors will notice within seconds of landing on your website, so it still counts as a first impression.
   - If it isn’t instantly clear what you do, your potential clients might bounce and close the page. To create a great tagline for your life coach business, follow this 5-step process.
3. Have a Call to Action
   - Your website needs to guide visitors to the actions you want them to take. Decide what that journey is and make it easy to follow.
   - It’s recommended to have a call to action right away in your hero section. This way, people ready to take action can contact you immediately without scrolling through everything.
   - The rest of your site can share more detailed information about your offers and repeat your call to action one or a few times.
4. Offer Free Resources
   - Free resources, be it a blog, podcast, YouTube channel, or guides, are key to helping you forge relationships with your prospects.
   - Establishing trust before they reach out to you will make your marketing efforts easier because they already know, like, and trust you. This is also an opportunity to expand the possibilities of how potential clients can find you.

5. Have a Great Structure
   - Your website needs a great structure for visitors to take desired actions and build trust. Your aesthetics also matter because judgments on website credibility are 75% based on a website’s overall look.
   - As a broad overview, you will need the following pages on your site:
     - Homepage
     - About
     - Services
     - Resources or blog
     - Contact page
   - Think about how you can get visitors to know, like, and trust you with each of these sections. - Include testimonials, professional photographs, and credentials to create social proof and increase credibility.
6. Make Your Services Clear
   - You need to be really clear on your services so people can identify the right fit for them.
   - Define what outcomes they will receive after working with you. Explain your process and what’s included in your packages besides sessions.
   - Some coaches prefer to share their prices or starting rates upfront, while others explain their pricing structure during discovery sessions. Both have their benefits, so it’s best to try out what - works best for your audience.
